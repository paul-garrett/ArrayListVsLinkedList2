# ArrayListVsLinkedList2

An ArrayList is faster than a LinkedList for every operation except for inserting or removing from either end of the list.

	In this example the program retrieves an item from a random index in the list.

	NOTE: The program takes several seconds to execute, so you will have to wait for the results.
